# Asymetric_volatility
An explorative note on the non-Gaussian innovations of the volatility process.

I investigate if the decomposition of the Standard Classical Laplace (SCL) distribution to a difference of two exponential is a valid alternative to modelling the asymmetric volatility processes, taking volatility clustering, the leverage effect and asymmetric response in volatility into account.

The source folder contains volatility process, probability densisty function and the Maximum Likelihood estimators (under construction).
