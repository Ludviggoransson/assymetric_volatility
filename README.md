# assymetric_volatility
An explorative note on the non-Gaussian innovations of the volatility process.

I investigate if the decomposition of the Standard Classical Laplace (SCL) distribution to a difference of two exponential is a valid alternative to modelling the asymmetric volatility processes, taking volatility clustering, the leverage effect and asymmetric response in volatility into account.
